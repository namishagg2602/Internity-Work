# Internity-Work
All the work done during Internity internship is available here.

1.
Data is collection of facts and information used to carry out analysis or computation.

2.
Data Structures are used to store the data in a particular structure or a format in an organized manner. 

3.
Abstract Data Types is a kind of data type whose behaviour is defined by the set of values and operations to be performed on them. 
But it doesn't define how the operation is going to be performed on data.
For example, let us consider STL "vector'', we can call vector_name.size() to get the size of a vector without knowing how it is being done. 

4.
Data structures are really useful in everyday life:
a-> Arrays are useful to store data in a linear format. 
      Ex: List of marks of students etc.
b-> We use matrix to store the data in a tabular format.
      Ex: Very useful while solving mathematical questions etc.
c-> We use stack to perform LIFO
      Ex: Undo function 
             Going back and forth while browsing etc.                 
d-> Graph is used for interconnectivity between nodes
     Ex: To represent each node as a city and finding shortest distances for travelling,
            To connect all the people on social media networks etc.
e-> Trees is used to store data in the form of a tree
     Ex: For indexing in Databases,
            DNS uses trees structure etc.

5.  Concepts of C++ such as OOPS, structures, Data Types revised.

6. Explored more on STL's such as Vector, Stack, Queue, Map, Pair, Priority Queue and Sets.
     Also, learned about their syntax and functions that come with them.
